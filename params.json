Just [create a new issue over here](https://github.com/itavero/AMNL-Mollie/issues).\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThis library uses kriswallsmith/Buzz and needs at least PHP 5.3 to work.\r\nThe easiest way to add this library to your project, is by adding `amnl/mollie` to your dependencies in [composer.json](http://getcomposer.org/).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis library may be used free of charge, however a link to this repository or my website is appreciated.\r\nFor more information, view the LICENSE file in the `master` branch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
