{"name":"AMNL\\Mollie","tagline":"PHP 5.3+ library for communicating with Mollie (PSP)","body":"The goal of this PHP 5.3+ library is to simplify the implementation of the payment methods offered by [Mollie B.V.](http://www.mollie.nl)\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nYou can easily install this library using Composer by adding it to your composer.json or by running this command from your command-line:\r\n```bash\r\nphp composer.phar require amnl/mollie\r\n```\r\nIf you will be using Symfony 2, you can choose to install the bundle created by @ruudk, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ruudk/MollieBundle).\r\nAnd finally, if you aren't using composer or Symfony 2, you can just download the code as an archive.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nEvery client implements the `AMNL\\Mollie\\ProviderGateway` interface. This is done to make it easier to implement the other payment methods when you've already implemented one. This also means that every client has a **checkPayment** and a **preparePayment** method.\r\n\r\n## iDEAL\r\nTo handle iDEAL payments we'll need an instance of `AMNL\\Mollie\\IDeal\\IDealGateway`. The constructor has the following parameters:\r\n* `$partner_id` - Your Mollie Partner ID (account number)\r\n* `$profile_key` - Profile key *[optional]*\r\n* `$testmode` - Set to false to disable the test mode *[optional - true by default]*\r\n* `$base_url` - Sets the base URL used for API calls *[optional - defaults to null, which means the default url will be used]*\r\n* `$client` - Instance of the Buzz client that should be used to issue requests. Should be an instance of *\\Buzz\\Client\\ClientInterface*.\r\n\r\nSo, let's say your Partner ID is `123456`, then you would need to following code to get started (assuming you have an autoloader mechanism in place).\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n$gateway = new \\AMNL\\Mollie\\IDeal\\IDealGateway(123456);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 0. Get list of banks\r\nBefore you can prepare a payment, we first need to know which bank the customer is going to use. You can get a list of banks by calling the `getBankList` method on the gateway instance, which gives you an array of `\\AMNL\\Mollie\\IDeal\\Bank`. You'll need a Bank-object or a bank ID when preparing a payment.\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n$banks = $gateway->getBankList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1. Prepare payment\r\nTo prepare a payment and get the URL you should redirect your customer to, you can call either the `preparePayment` or the `prepareIDealPayment` method on the gateway instance. The latter will call the former internally.\r\n\r\nThe method signature of *preparePayment* is pretty much compatible across all the different payment gateways included in this library. *preparePayment* accepts the following parameters:\r\n* `$amount` - Amount that must be paid, in **Euro cents**\r\n* `$report_url` - URL that will be called to inform your application of a status update\r\n* `$return_url` - URL the customer will be send to after the payment process is done (even if it was unsuccessful!)\r\n* `$description` - Description which will be visible to the customer\r\n* `$options` - Array of additional options needed for a specific gateway. In case of the *IDealGateway* this should contain a key *bank* which has a Bank instance or a bank ID (int / string) as its value.\r\n\r\n### 2. Redirect the user\r\nWhen the payment is prepared the `preparePayment` method returns an instance of `AMNL\\Mollie\\ProviderResponse`. This object has three properties:\r\n* `transactionId` - The name says it all: identifier for the transaction that has just been created.\r\n* `amount` - Amount in eurocents\r\n* `destination` - URL to which the user should be forwarded\r\n\r\nMost likely you would want to store the `transactionId` (for example in an Order object), before forwarding the user to the URL provided in `destination`.\r\n\r\n### 3. Thank You!\r\nIt's very likely that the user will return on the *return_url* set in *1. Prepare Payment* before the transaction has been cleared. You might want to say thank you on the page served at the return_url and let the user know his/her transaction is being processed.\r\n\r\n### 4. Get transaction status\r\nWhen the *report_url* is called, it's time to get the status of the transaction. Mollie sends the transaction ID along in the GET-parameter called *transaction_id* (pretty straight-forward right?).\r\nAll you have to do is call the `checkPayment` method on an *IDealGateway* instance and supply the transaction identifier as the first and only argument.\r\n\r\nThe method will return a `IDealTransactionStatus` (which inherits from the \"global\" `AMNL\\Mollie\\TransactionStatus`).\r\n\r\nThe property you'll be most interested in is `paid` (isPaid).\r\n\r\n**Important note (pre v1.0.1):** If a transaction had the status \"paid\" (`paid == true`) and you request the status a second time, `paid` will still be true. This behaviour is different from the default implementation that Mollie uses. However, you can check the `status` property (which contains the message received from the API) to see if you have checked the transaction status before.\r\n**This behavior is no longer present in release v1.0.1 and later. For more information, see [issue #17](//github.com/itavero/AMNL-Mollie/issues/17).**\r\n\r\n## Other payment services\r\n**AMNL\\Mollie** also offers support for Paysafecard, Minitix and IVR (micropayments). However we will not discuss those here, since the API of these gateways and the workflow are pretty much similar to the iDeal example given above.\r\n\r\n# Questions, bugs or other issues\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the original author: [Arno Moonen](http://arnom.nl) [@itavero](http://github.com/itavero) on GitHub).\r\n\r\nIf you come across a bug or notice some unexpected behavior, please [add a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/itavero/AMNL-Mollie/issues).","google":"UA-13135527-17","note":"Don't delete this file!
